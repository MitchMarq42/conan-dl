### THIS IS THE OLD VERSION. IT DOESN'T MATTER.
### IT ALSO CREATES A BUNCH OF EXTRA FILES IN /tmp.
### DO NOT USE IT, IT DOESN'T WORK.

# A complete rewrite of conan-dl(archived here as cdl-curl), a program which scrapes anime from basic non-JS sites.
# This version relies on GNU Wget, which has nicer progress bars, more command-line options, and slightly better domain resolution. However, it is arguably more bloated than cURL, and so I have attempted to strike a balance between the two in the included conan-dl file. This script, however, is uses wget for everything.
#
# One day I may also try to replace all awk commands with sed commands for a similar reason.
# But that time is not now. Anyway, read the code and read the config file and check the README.
# Aight let's get down to it.
